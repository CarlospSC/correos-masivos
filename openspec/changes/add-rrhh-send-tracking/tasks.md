## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add RRHH segment constant and persist send records for each recipient
- [x] 1.2 Skip RRHH send when a SENT record exists for the same segment + recipient
- [x] 1.3 Scope actualizar_envios.py to the RRHH segment and mark missing message IDs as ERROR
- [ ] 1.4 Manual validation: run a test send and a status update for the RRHH segment
